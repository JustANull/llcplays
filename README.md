What's the point?
-----------------

This project is intended to be a complete TwitchPlaysPokemon style bot set up for my personal use.

Can I use it?
-------------

Knock yourself out. I'm not going to stop you. If you want to remove the userlist support (e.g. allow anybody to use your bot) you'll need to edit `control.py`.
